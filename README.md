# ConnectSense-Smart-Room-Using-ArduinoUNO

A Mini Project on IOT Based Smart System developed for (T.E - IT) Internet-of-Things project.

Abstract -
ConnectSense Smart Room System is created to perform day to day task such as turning appliances On and Off, These are small things which effects an individual financial state also. Connect Sense Smart Room System is made of various sensors which include Arduino, PSU, Ultrasonic Distance Sensor, PIR Sensor, Gas Sensor, Temperature Sensor, Photoresistor, Infrared Sensor with Remote, Relay SPDT. Every sensor have its own role. This system allows the person to control the sensors with a switch and let the sensors carry out the tasks as per use. This system will automatically turn on and off appliances like fan, light and it will also control the speed of appliances that are adjustable according to the temperature of the room. Ultrasonic distance sensor will determine the distance so the doors will automatically open and close accordingly, PIR sensor will detect the motions and turn on and off appliances accordingly, temperature sensor will detect the temperature and control the speed of appliances. PSU will supply power to the system. This system can be used for security purpose as well if needed.

# The Project is Simulated on AutoDesk's TinkerCAD
